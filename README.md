## 🌍 Overview

This automation uses **Telegram** and **OpenAI’s multimodal model** to analyze meal photos and summarize daily nutrition intake — all through a seamless chat interface.  

The idea is simple:  
📸 Just **send photos of your meals** to the Telegram bot during the day.  
At the end of the day, the bot automatically:  
1. Fetches all your meal photos from Telegram  
2. Uses OpenAI Vision to analyze each meal’s nutritional content  
3. Summarizes your daily intake (Calories, Protein, Fats, etc.)  
4. Suggests **what to improve in your diet for tomorrow**

No apps, no calorie logging — just pure automation powered by AI. ⚡

Just **send your meal photos to Telegram**, and the AI handles:
- Food recognition  
- Nutrition estimation  
- Daily intake summary

You get health awareness with zero effort. 🧘‍♂️
